# MediCamb â€“ Intelligent Medicine Recognition & Healthcare Assistant

ðŸ§  MediCamb is an AI-powered healthcare assistant that allows users to upload photos of medicines to identify them and retrieve detailed medical information like ingredients, usage, and side effects. It also features an AI chatbot for general medical queries and health advice.

ðŸš§ This project is a work in progress.

## How It Works

1. User uploads an image of a medicine.
2. The app extracts text using OCR and identifies the medicine.
3. The backend matches it with known data and returns:
   - Name
   - Ingredients
   - Usage instructions
   - Side effects
4. Users can also chat with the built-in AI bot for health-related queries.
